Python-based reference manager developed for a class assignment. Available in two versions:
  - **gestor_gui.py:** stores information in a .txt file
  - **sqlversion.py:** stores information in a SQL database

User manual is available in the "Relatórios" folder (Portuguese only as of now).

Both versions come with "test" entries that can be removed using the "Eliminar referências" button.
